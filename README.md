## About ##

My submission for "Challenge #3", from the @RocketSeatEducation Ignite Node.js learning path.

Back-end in Node.js with problems and failing tests, the challenge was to resolve the issues and pass all unit tests.

Repos I Do Like : It likes the repos that ... I ... do like (kind of).

## Success Criteria ## 

- [  ] Should be able to give a like to the repository;
- [  ] Should not be able to give a like to a non existing repository;
- [  ] Should be able to create a new repository;
- [  ] Should be able to list the projects;
- [  ] Should be able to update repository;
- [  ] Should not be able to update a non existing repository;
- [  ] Should not be able to update repository likes manually;
- [  ] Should be able to delete the repository;
- [  ] Should not be able to delete a non existing repository.
